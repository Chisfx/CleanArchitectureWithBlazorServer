0>Permissions structure had to be added
1>Users Edit page,fetch users based upon logged in user tenant & role
2>Only root admin will have permission to add to add roles
3>For patient/leaf level roles no separate claims stored,remaining all will be with asusual userclaims

            Users page, load tenants which are allowed to me ...
---------------on change load based on UserRoles table,rather Users table

-----------------role update-also make changes based on Active state.

self register, assign default tenant and default role as guest
-externallogin


others adding then add under creator tenant if not then add default tenant & role
-users page
remove some more from ui project for security
------remove applicationdbcontext 

while fetching role or userrole had to look for isactive and tenant(mostly done)
move all activity to services and avoid using usermanager ,instead use userservices
---------------------on users page load,checkmark of istenat-user active based on role selection condition
---------------tenant based search implemented
------------users page based on tenant ,need to load roles  implemented 








0>Switch tenant feature for users ,possibly on landing page(Heading) makes useful 

1>Load tenants based upon the user role and tenants on admin pages,as ,multi-level roles
2>On used edit page,based upon role changes load roles
For both 1 & 2 make common function called load tenant based on user role/tenant all

  //todo fetch tenants of allowed only based on user role/permissions
  //as this is admin page,
  //for internal load all tenants
  //any others ,load only of there tenants
  //user search separate page
