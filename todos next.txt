0>Switch tenant feature for users ,possibly on landing page(Heading) makes useful 

1>Load tenants based upon the user role and tenants on admin pages,as ,multi-level roles
2>On used edit page,based upon role changes load roles
For both 1 & 2 make common function called load tenant based on user role/tenant all

  //for internal load all tenants
  //any others ,load only of there tenants
  //user search separate page
