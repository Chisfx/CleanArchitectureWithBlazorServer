All place permissions,had to do additional validation with tenantid,as current is common role for all tenant
extend AuthrizeAsync

Someone registers first as a User of Patient/Guest
then let them add request for new tenant as H/P/D

FOr new tenant creation request,lets make other page by user home screen
Request for New Hospital/P/Dia
For internal admin,one page already exists...need to modify with type of tenant and more details like default admin account...
with same layout by other users lets add option like add new tenant but it goes for admin approval

On Users page, allow only to make existing tenants operation + Existing all base tenants type excluding (existing+Internal)
ex1: Patient+ Existing other Hospital+Existing Pharmacy+Existing DiagCenter
ex2: Internal+ Patient+ Existing Hospital+Existing Pharmacy+Existing DiagCenter
ex3: Nanjappa hospital+Sarji hospital+ Patient+ Existing Hospital+Existing Pharmacy+Existing DiagCenter
    if existing Hospital choosen then list all existing hospital in new dropdown & roles common for all 
    if existing Pharmacy choosen then list all existing Pharmacies in new dropdown & roles common for all 




Patient no need of separate role under patient tenant

On users page,tenants should order by selected first and then others
User self login,allow them to change tenants of choice and ask them to logout & login

On user profile page, show all of his tenants and at first already choosed tenants lise active then incative then remaining

once account verified,email edit disable or validate before assigning new account
Login happens throgh, Infrashtructure=>BlazorAuthStateProvider then  AccessTokenProvider

Usermanager() createasync make it ready for Adding UserClaims line 65
remove DefaultRole1 from default roles ,make it only user friendly


Each fetch should verify is approved/active otherwise no like doctor
Actions:
Patient add,edit,delete,view,edit insurance,transactionofHospital
Prescription add,edit,view
All ROles Add,edit,view,delete


0>Permissions structure had to be added
1>Users Edit page,fetch users based upon logged in user tenant & role
2>Only root admin will have permission to add to add roles
3>For patient/leaf level roles no separate claims stored,remaining all will be with asusual userclaims
4>Users edit profile page,had to allow change of tenants for self ,so to raise request
5>Then approval of new request and processing
6>Users common search page, like patient search/doctor/jospital search .

7>Prescription structure ,view rightsand all
8>Insurance and other additional details
9>Cost,initial 30days free, then 2 options like use ondemand or use subscription
10>

            Users page, load tenants which are allowed to me ...
---------------on change load based on UserRoles table,rather Users table

-----------------role update-also make changes based on Active state.

self register, assign default tenant and default role as guest
-externallogin


others adding then add under creator tenant if not then add default tenant & role
-users page
remove some more from ui project for security
------remove applicationdbcontext 

while fetching role or userrole had to look for isactive and tenant(mostly done)
move all activity to services and avoid using usermanager ,instead use userservices
---------------------on users page load,checkmark of istenat-user active based on role selection condition
---------------tenant based search implemented
------------users page based on tenant ,need to load roles  implemented 








0>Switch tenant feature for users ,possibly on landing page(Heading) makes useful 

1>Load tenants based upon the user role and tenants on admin pages,as ,multi-level roles
2>On used edit page,based upon role changes load roles
For both 1 & 2 make common function called load tenant based on user role/tenant all

  //todo fetch tenants of allowed only based on user role/permissions
  //as this is admin page,
  //for internal load all tenants
  //any others ,load only of there tenants
  //user search separate page

  Nuget package update to latest stable working set
